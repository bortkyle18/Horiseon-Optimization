# Search Engine Optimization

To optimize Horiseon's webpage fore search engines, div elements were replaced with semantic elements when applicable. While refactoring Horiseon's webpage I also went through the HTML and CSS code to better identify sections with comments and clean up any messy code. A list of edits made to both documents is provided below:


# HTML Header
    Changed title to Horiseon.
    Changed div header to header and div inside header to nav. Updated style sheet accordingly.

# HTML CONTENT:
    Added ID to link nav to the search engine optimization section.
    Changed div to section and the divs inside the section element to article to better define section for search engines.
    Added alt  description to images.

# HTML BENIFITS:
    Changed div to section and the divs inside the section element to aside to better define section for search engines.
    Added alt description to images.

# HTML FOOTER:
    Changed div to footer.

# CSS EDITS:
    Combined header elements and made it an element distinction instead of class.
    Combined content stylings into a content class instead of using individual classes for each article.
    Combined benifits stylings into a benifits class instead of using individual classes for each div.
    Turned footer into an element distinction instead of class.
    Reorganized style sheet to keep benifits and content info next to each other.
